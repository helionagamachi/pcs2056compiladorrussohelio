Files that are in this folder can be found by this way in any class:
this.getClass().getResource("/readme");
this method will return null if nothing is found, in case that a file is found
it will return a URL object, to get the file path, use this method:
testFile.getFile()
This seems to be a good way to get files for test, or config
